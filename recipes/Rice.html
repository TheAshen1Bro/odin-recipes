    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Tomato rice is another Mexican dish I ate growing up. It compliments lots of other food, especially meats such as chicken, pork, fish, etc. It's fairly simple to make and doesn't take too much time. About 40 minutes maximum.</p>
        <p> It's a great starter dish if you're just learning how to cook, especially if you don't get it right the first time. Jasmine rice, which I use, is not expensive so it's good to experiment with the recipe to suit your tastes. It also fills you up fairly decently in case you want something to eat quickly and cost effectively.</p>
