        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Champurrado is a Mexican recipe I and many of my famiy members would have for breakfast growing up. You usually serve it really hot in a mug such as the one pictured above. It goes great with pastries such as bollilo, conchas, cuernitos. It also goes great with other Mexican foods such as tamales.</p>
            <p>Champurrado is fairly simple to make and shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. It's the chocolate version of what is known as Atole. In my opinion it is better, but you can enjoy both by just taking the chocolate out of the equation. Hope you enjoy drinking it as much as I did growing up.</p>
